## Usage

This mock-up login page is designed to demonstrate the basic functionality of a user authentication system. To use this page:

1. Open the webpage in your preferred web browser.
2. Enter your login credentials into the provided fields. For demonstration purposes, you can use any username and password, as this mock-up does not verify user information.
3. Click the "Login" button to submit your credentials. Upon clicking, your entered information will be displayed in the console (for development purposes) to simulate storing or processing login information.
4. After submitting, observe the console log (accessible via the browser's developer tools) to see the login information you entered. This step is intended to show how login data could be captured and handled in a real application.

Please note, this page is a static mock-up and does not provide actual authentication or redirect to another page upon login. It's intended for demonstration and development purposes only.
